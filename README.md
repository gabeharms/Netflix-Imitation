### Netflix Web App

This is a web app I created that mocks the netflix interface using Node.js, ReactJS, and Redux. The web app is a single SPA that uses ReactRouter for navigation. Functionality includes searching, dynamic/real-time filtering, list pages, and detail pages. I created this project in order to expand my React/Redux skill set as I see its popularity growing in the industry.


To run: 
* install node & npm
* run 'npm install'
* finally run 'node app' to start the server on 5050
