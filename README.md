### Netflix Web App
This is a web app I created that mocks the netflix interface using Node.js, ReactJS, and Redux. I created it while at a React/Redux workshop taught by one of the developers at netflix who is a part of Frontend Masters. The web app is a single SPA that uses ReactRouter for navigation. Functionality includes searching, filtering, list pages, and detail pages.
